        <p>Hi hi, I'm eesomie and I am currently taking a gap year due to unfortunate circumstances but making light of the situation by honing my art skills, developing IT skills and learning 3D based artwort!</p>

        <p>When im not scribbling, I enjoy spending time gaming alone or with friends, going on walks, doing yoga or cooking new recipes to try with my partner!</p>
